A. "ILCM.R" contains contains two functions: 
 1) "Nuclear" function that fits the integrative latent class model using training data; and
 2) "Nuclear_predict" function that predicts the obstruction status status of a new kidney

B. "simulated_data.Rdata" contains the simulated dataset that mimic that of the Emory Renal study

C. "data_analysis_example.R" contains the R code for applying the proposed method (code) to the simulated dataset.

D. Figures S11 and S12 in the Supplementary Materials of our manuscript can be reproduced by the code "data_analysis_example.R" and simulated dataset "simulated_data.Rdata"
